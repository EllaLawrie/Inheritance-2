                >Hi! I am Emmanuella Amukwuo, I've known at an early age that
                computers have a special pull over me. Even as a young child, I
                enjoyed using my boxy computer, which had half the memory of the
                one I use now to program, and watching the internet. For me, the
                most fascinating thing about computers was how people were drawn
                to their games and how much they adored the plots and characters
                they featured. Since I discovered that, yes, people do create
                those games, my ambition has been to work as a software engineer
                who can create entire worlds on a disk. Of course, the challenge
                with creating content that everyone enjoys is figuring out what
                everyone wants and occasionally even modifying it. Everything
                I've done thus far outside of my coding classes has been to
                educate myself on the more creative and professional parts of
                computer programming that we typically don't consider. I've
                learned everything my teachers, both in and out of school, have
                to teach me about programming itself, so I'm aiming to continue
                my education here at STUTERN. What I can do right now is get
                ready to think more broadly and concentrate on my ability to
                collaborate with and build upon others, which will ultimately
                increase my real coding skills. I am confident that if I mix the
                minds of a programmer, a businesswoman, and an artist, I would
                be able to develop games and websites that will leave people in
                awe.</i

                which are the basics, the intermediate and the standard.
                Cascading style sheets, or CSS. Simply put, CSS is a design
                language that enhances a website's visual appeal beyond that of
                plain or uninteresting text. CSS is crucial because it improves
                user experience and makes a website's front end sparkle.
                Websites without CSS would certainly be substantially more
                difficult to browse and less aesthetically pleasant. CSS is in
                charge of font color in addition to layout and format.</i

                contents and the box's border. Borders might be a broad, colored
                line or they can be invisible. Margin is the area outside of a
                box, more-like the area surrounding the border of an element.</i
